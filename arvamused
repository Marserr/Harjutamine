Github on veits veider, ning mul on raksusi selle arusaamisega. Ma ilmeslt ei viitsiks seda kasutada.
The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. 
The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco.
